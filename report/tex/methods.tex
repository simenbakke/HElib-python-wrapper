\chapter{Methods}
In this chapter, we describe the methods used in our approach. We will first describe the dataset, which includes data collection, class distribution and training/test partitioning. We then describe the general design of convolutional neural networks and how we train them. We will describe all experiments performed on the lung sound dataset. The experiments are wheeze detection, breathing phase detection and full file classification. For each experiment, we will describe data preprocessing, model architecture and training details for the best performing model. Finally, we will explain the design and implementation of an prototype that can utilize the capabilities of our lung sound analysis system. The lung sound analysis system is a system that uses the best performing model from each experiment.
