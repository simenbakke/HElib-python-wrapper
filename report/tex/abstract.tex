A Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme allows you to perform an arbitrary number of computation on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This is a very useful feature as it allows us to perform computations on data without knowing the data itself. Computations on sensitive data can be done in an untrusted environment without compromising privacy. Even though this may sound like the holy grail of cryptography which could solve the worlds IT problems when it comes to security and trust, it have some issues. Unfortunately Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) libraries are very limited in Python. In this paper we have implemented a Python API based of a FHE C++ library called HElib and we will take a look at potential usages and limitations to the library.
